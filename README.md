# IMGD5010-Assignment3-Time
For this assignment, I decided to build upon my assignment from last week. In my assignment last week, I used p5js to draw hexagons in a honeycomb grid pattern, and each hexagon was a different shade of yellow/orange. 

## My Graphical Element
Since I decided to build upon my previous work, my choice of a single graphical element is a hexagon. I also decided to keep the code which fills each hexagon a different shade of yellow/orange.

## My Hexagon Over Time
I created a moving image where each hexagon in a grid is graphically drawn in the correct location in the grid, but with a smaller radius. Over time, the hexagon grows in size and rotates, until it is the proper size to fit the grid. It then continues to rotate until the other hexagons in the grid have been drawn and grown to proper size. The hexagons then continue to rotate until they lock into place, forming a honeycomb pattern similar to my assignment 2 submission. The code can be found in honeycomb-time.py in this repo, and you can go to this [link](https://editor.p5js.org/mebraen/full/Se_PR0irk) to see the code in action. The full code in the p5js web editor is also available [here](https://editor.p5js.org/mebraen/sketches/Se_PR0irk).
